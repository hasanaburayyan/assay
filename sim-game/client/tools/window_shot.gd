## A PICTURE OF THE REAL WINDOW, at 1:1, with no hands (ASSA-116 box 5).
##
##   godot --path . --script res://tools/window_shot.gd -- <out_dir> [seed] [ticks]
##
## NOT `--headless`, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT. Every other tool in here runs headless because it
## is asking what the client KNOWS. This one asks what the client LOOKS LIKE, and a dummy rendering
## driver answers that question with an empty image -- `--headless` reads back a blank frame and
## reports success, which is the most expensive kind of green there is.
##
## WHY IT EXISTS. Until now the only way to see this window was somebody's hands on this Mac
## (Decision #34, where the board had to open the app and describe it). So the look of the thing was
## the one part of the game nobody could iterate on: a change had to be exported, downloaded, opened
## and described back. Everything we have called a "1:1 render" (ASSA-83/99/105) was a drawing of a
## panel made beside the game, never the panel. This writes PNGs of the actual screen, so the Game
## Director can rule on a picture of what shipped.
##
## WHAT IT SHOOTS, and why these three:
##  - `01-join.png`   the first screen a stranger sees, before any press.
##  - `02-play.png`   mid-session, every panel carrying real content from a played world.
##  - `03-log.png`    the same screen with the event log open and the crafting menu folded away.
##
## THE LOG SHOT IS NOT OPTIONAL AND IT IS WHY `_shoot` REFUSES A REPEAT. The board's complaint is
## "logs are hard on the eyes", and the played session ENDS with the log hidden and the menu open --
## `AssayButtonPlay` presses those toggles itself on its way through the loop. So the first version
## of this script asked for a state the screen was already in, and wrote 02 and 03 as byte-identical
## files while reporting three shots taken. A set of pictures that silently contains the same picture
## twice is worse than a missing one: it reads as coverage.
##
## THE WORLD IS OFFLINE AND PLAYED BY THE BUTTONS, borrowed whole from `tools/button_session.gd`:
## this script is the relay, and `AssayButtonPlay` presses the screen's own controls. So the panels
## are full of what a player's panels would hold, not of a fixture I typed. A shot of a world nobody
## played would flatter every panel that only looks wrong once it has rows in it.
##
## Prints `WINDOW SHOT OK` LAST and only on success, because Godot exits 0 even on a compile error.

## Frames to let pass before reading the viewport back. One is not enough: the screen is built from
## containers, and a container lays its children out on the frame AFTER they are added, so a capture
## on frame 1 catches every row at position zero, stacked on the origin. Three is slack, not science.

## READ THE FRAME BACK AND WRITE IT OUT, refusing a blank one and refusing a repeat.
##
## TWO WAYS A SET OF SHOTS LIES, and both have already happened to me here.
##
## BLANK: a render that produced an empty image. That is exactly what `--headless` does, and a PNG
## of nothing is indistinguishable from a PNG of a screen until somebody opens it. So a frame has to
## carry more than one colour before this calls it a shot.
##
## REPEAT: the screen was asked for a state it was already in, so two named shots are the same
## picture. Nothing is blank, every count looks healthy, and the set reads as covering two states
## while covering one. Comparing the bytes is the only thing that catches it, and it is cheap.

## WHAT IS ACTUALLY ON SCREEN, as a number rather than as my reading of a picture.
##
## A shot shows what is visible; it cannot show what is MISSING, and the two look the same. The
## first set of shots here caught the event log being nowhere on screen with its own toggle reading
## "hide the event log" -- `_log.visible` was true and the section was simply below the bottom of a
## scrolling column that overflows a 720px window. That is invisible to every test we have, because
## every one of them asks the node and the node answers honestly.
##
## So each named section reports its rect against the window. `visible` and `on screen` are
## different questions and this is the one nobody was asking.
